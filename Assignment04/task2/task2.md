## Task 2: Marketplace 3

This week, you are to extend your implementation of the Marketplace task from last week.
If you didnâ€™t work on it last week or had issues with it, you can download the **sample solution** for Assignment 2 from the Stud.IP file section of the exercise under `Marketplace2.zip`.

---

### a) Implement the method:

```java
public User login()
```

* This method should **read a username and password up to 3 times**.
* If a user with the entered username **and** password exists in the `Marketplace`, return that user.
* If the login **fails 3 times**, the program should exit using `System.exit(0)`.

---

### b) Implement the method:

```java
public void cli()
```

This method should implement the following **command-line interface (CLI)** features.
Creating and using helper functions is explicitly allowed.

#### CLI Functionalities:

1. Add an item
2. Remove an item
3. Modify an item's name, description, and price
4. Show all items in a category
5. Exit the program

**Note**: A user may only **remove or modify items they own**.

1. Add item
