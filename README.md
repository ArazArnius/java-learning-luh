# Java Learning â€“ LUH 2nd Semester

This is an ongoing collection of Java programming tasks and exercises I'm working on during my second semester of the Informatik B.Sc. program at Leibniz University Hannover (LUH).

## About

As I continue learning Java, I'm uploading my homework assignments, small practice projects, and experiments. This repository will grow over time as I progress through the course.

The specific detail of the contents can be found in each assignment's folder separately.

Feel free to check out the code, and suggestions are always welcome!
